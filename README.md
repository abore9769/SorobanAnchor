# SorobanAnchor

A Soroban smart contract SDK for Stellar anchors. Handles attestation management, SEP-6 deposit/withdrawal flows, SEP-10 JWT authentication, anchor routing, rate limiting, and transaction state tracking — all in a `no_std` Rust library compiled to WASM.

## What it does

- Registers and revokes attestors with SEP-10 JWT verification
- Submits and retrieves on-chain attestations with replay attack protection
- Normalizes SEP-6 deposit, withdrawal, and transaction status responses across anchors
- Verifies SEP-10 EdDSA JWTs on-chain using stored Ed25519 public keys
- Routes requests across multiple anchors and asset pairs by reputation, fees, and settlement time
- Caches anchor metadata and stellar.toml capabilities with TTL-based expiry
- Tracks transaction state transitions with full audit logging
- Propagates request IDs and tracing spans across operations
- Enforces rate limits and configurable retry/backoff strategies
- Validates anchor domain endpoints and response schemas

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

For WASM output (Soroban deployment):

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm
```

Generate browsable API reference docs for the public crate exports:

```bash
make api-docs
```

The generated HTML is written to `target/api-docs/doc/anchorkit/index.html`.

### Build Matrix

SorobanAnchor supports two distinct build environments with complete feature separation:

| Configuration | Command | Target | Output | CLI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Native (default)** | `cargo build --release` | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `target/release/anchorkit` | ✓ Yes |
| **WASM/Soroban** | `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm` | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/anchorkit.wasm` | ✗ No |

**Key differences:**
- **Native**: Includes CLI, HTTP client (`reqwest`), filesystem access, and credential storage
- **WASM**: Minimal runtime, no std library, only smart contract code for Soroban

Both builds are verified by the automated test suite:

```bash
./scripts/test_build_matrix.sh
```

For detailed information about build paths, features, and environment separation, see [docs/build-matrix.md](docs/build-matrix.md).

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

Run the stress-test suite (excluded from normal CI):

```bash
cargo test --features stress-tests
```

## Feature flags

The crate uses four feature flags to control which modules are compiled.

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `std` | ✓ | Enables filesystem-based config loading (`load_runtime_config_file`, `RuntimeConfig`). Disable for pure no_std environments. |
| `wasm` | — | Soroban on-chain deployment target. Excludes all HTTP/host modules (`sep6`, `sep24`, `sep38`, `webhook`, `streaming_monitor`); only the contract, error types, rate limiter, and cryptographic utilities are compiled. |
| `mock-only` | — | Enables the `mock` module with pre-built valid fixtures for every response type. Use in integration tests and CI pipelines that have no live anchor. |
| `stress-tests` | — | Enables `tests/load_simulation_tests.rs` — high-concurrency and throughput tests excluded from normal CI. |

### Build variants

```bash
# Native development (default features)
cargo build

# Soroban on-chain WASM deployment
cargo build --release \
  --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --no-default-features --features wasm

# Testing with mock fixtures (no live anchor)
cargo test --features mock-only

# Testing with mock fixtures and config (std + mock)
cargo test --features std,mock-only

# Full suite including stress tests
cargo test --features std,mock-only,stress-tests

# Library only, no std (no_std verification)
cargo check --no-default-features
```

### Using mock fixtures

```rust
use anchorkit::mock::{mock_deposit_response, mock_firm_quote};
use anchorkit::{initiate_deposit, sep38::request_firm_quote};

// Test the deposit parsing pipeline without a live anchor
let raw = mock_deposit_response();
let deposit = initiate_deposit(raw).unwrap();
assert_eq!(deposit.transaction_id, "mock-txn-001");

// Test SEP-38 quote parsing
let raw_quote = mock_firm_quote();
let quote = request_firm_quote(raw_quote, 1_700_000_000).unwrap();
assert!(!quote.id.is_empty());
```

## CLI

```bash
# Check environment setup before doing anything else
anchorkit doctor

# Validate config files offline (no network access required)
anchorkit offline validate

# Deploy to testnet
anchorkit deploy --network testnet

# Deploy to mainnet (prompts for confirmation unless --yes is passed)
anchorkit deploy --network mainnet --yes

# Register an attestor
anchorkit register --address GANCHOR123... --services deposits,withdrawals,kyc

# Submit an attestation
anchorkit attest --subject GUSER123... --payload-hash abc123...

# Verify an attestation and check contract/rate-limiter health
anchorkit verify --id 42
anchorkit health --contract-id $ANCHOR_CONTRACT_ID --attestor GANCHOR123...
```

**Walkthroughs and troubleshooting:** see [`examples/full_deployment_walkthrough.sh`](examples/full_deployment_walkthrough.sh)
for an end-to-end operator tour (doctor → validate → deploy → register →
attest → verify → health) with a troubleshooting section for common errors.
Other scenario walkthroughs live in [`examples/`](examples/):

| Example | Covers |
|---|---|
| `full_deployment_walkthrough.sh` | End-to-end deploy → register → attest → verify, plus troubleshooting |
| `attestation_workflow.sh` | Registration, plain/session/traced attestations, replay protection |
| `rate_limit_override_example.sh` | Per-role and per-attestor rate limit overrides |
| `config_hot_reload_example.rs` | Reloading runtime config without restarting the process |
| `credential_management.sh` | Encrypted keystore vs. env var vs. keypair file |
| `mock_mode_example.sh` | Testing CLI flows without a live anchor |
| `offline_mode_example.sh` | Config validation and workflow simulation with no network |
| `anchor_info_discovery.sh` | Fetching and interpreting a `stellar.toml` |
| `kyc_workflow.sh` | KYC-gated attestation flow |
| `role_usage_example.sh` | Admin roles and capability delegation |

## Supported SEP Versions

The contract explicitly exposes which Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) it supports via two on-chain methods:

```rust
// Returns [6, 10, 24, 31, 38]
let seps: Vec<u32> = AnchorKitContract::supported_seps(env);

// Returns per-SEP boolean flags
let flags: SepFeatureFlags = AnchorKitContract::supported_sep_feature_flags(env);
assert!(flags.sep10); // SEP-10 JWT authentication is supported
```

| SEP | Description | Supported |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| [SEP-6](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md) | Non-interactive deposit and withdrawal | ✓ |
| [SEP-10](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0010.md) | Stellar Web Authentication (JWT) | ✓ |
| [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) | Interactive deposit and withdrawal | ✓ |
| [SEP-31](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0031.md) | Direct payment | ✓ |
| [SEP-38](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0038.md) | Anchor RFQ / firm quotes | ✓ |

Constants are also exported from the `contract` module: `SEP_6`, `SEP_10`, `SEP_24`, `SEP_31`, `SEP_38`.

## Key APIs

```rust
// SEP-6: normalize a raw anchor deposit response
let response = initiate_deposit(raw)?;

// SEP-10: verify an anchor JWT on-chain
contract.verify_sep10_token(token, issuer);

// Submit an attestation (replay-protected)
let id = contract.submit_attestation(issuer, subject, timestamp, payload_hash, sig);

// Route across anchors by lowest fee
let best = contract.route(options);

// Route across multiple asset pairs (multi-asset, #656)
use anchorkit::multi_asset_routing::{route_multi_asset, AssetPairRequest};
let requests = vec![
    AssetPairRequest { base_asset: "XLM".into(), quote_asset: "USDC".into(), amount: 1000, strategy: "LowestFee".into(), min_reputation: 70 },
];
let result = route_multi_asset(&requests, &all_quotes, now_timestamp)?;

// Track transaction state
tracker.transition(tx_id, TransactionStatus::Completed);
```

## Configuration

Anchor configs live in `configs/` as JSON or TOML. Validate them with:

```bash
./scripts/validate_all.sh
```

Schema reference: `config_schema.json`

### Runtime config hot-reload

Long-running host processes (not the on-chain contract, which already
applies admin updates immediately) can pick up config file changes without
restarting, via `RuntimeConfigManager`:

```rust
use anchorkit::config::RuntimeConfigManager;

let manager = RuntimeConfigManager::new("configs/remittance-anchor.toml")?;
// ... later, on a timer or file-watch event ...
match manager.reload_if_changed() {
    Ok(true)  => println!("config reloaded"),
    Ok(false) => {} // unchanged
    Err(e)    => eprintln!("reload rejected, previous config kept: {e}"),
}
let current = manager.current();
```

A reload that fails to parse or fails shape validation is rejected and the
previously loaded configuration stays active. See
[`examples/config_hot_reload_example.rs`](examples/config_hot_reload_example.rs).

## Integration Testing

The repository ships a CLI integration test harness that exercises the full
deploy → initialize → register → attest → verify workflow using the Soroban
local simulation environment (no network required by default).

```bash
# Run all integration harness tests (local simulation)
cargo test --test cli_integration_harness

# Or via Make
make integration-test
```

The harness covers:

| Step | What is tested |
|------|---------------|
| 1 | Contract deployment and admin initialization |
| 2 | Attestor registration (SEP-10 JWT flow) |
| 3 | Service capability configuration |
| 4 | Attestation submission and retrieval |
| 5 | Session-based workflow with audit logging |
| 6 | Quote submission and LowestFee routing |
| 7 | Attestor revocation and cleanup |
| E2E | Full pipeline in a single test |
| 9 | KYC submit → approve workflow |
| 10 | CLI binary smoke tests (`doctor`, `deploy --dry-run`) |
| 11 | Live testnet smoke test (opt-in) |

### Live testnet tests

Set the following environment variables to run the live testnet step:

```bash
export SOROBAN_ANCHOR_INTEGRATION=testnet
export ANCHOR_CONTRACT_ID=<deployed-contract-id>
export ANCHOR_ADMIN_SECRET=<admin-secret-key>

make integration-test-live
```

## Release Packaging

Production releases are built and bundled with a single Make target:

```bash
make release
```

This runs `scripts/package_release.sh` which:

1. Ensures the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target is installed.
2. Builds the native CLI binary (`target/release/anchorkit`).
3. Builds the optimized WASM contract (`target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/anchorkit.wasm`).
4. Runs `wasm-opt -Oz` if binaryen is available.
5. Assembles a bundle directory under `dist/anchorkit-<VERSION>/` containing:
   - `anchorkit` — CLI binary
   - `anchorkit.wasm` — Soroban WASM contract
   - `schemas/config_schema.json` — JSON schema for anchor configs
   - `configs/` — Example anchor configurations (JSON + TOML)
   - `docs/` — Documentation
   - `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `VERSION`
6. Creates `dist/anchorkit-<VERSION>.tar.gz`.
7. Generates a SHA-256 checksum file.

### Validating the bundle

```bash
make release-validate
# or directly:
./scripts/validate_bundle.sh dist/anchorkit-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

The validation script checks that all required artifacts are present and that
JSON files are well-formed.

### Signing and verifying

Release artifacts can be signed with GPG or minisign and verified before use:

```bash
# Sign (GPG by default)
make release-sign

# Sign in dry-run mode (prints commands without executing)
make release-sign-dry-run

# Verify a downloaded release bundle
make release-verify TARBALL=dist/anchorkit-0.1.0.tar.gz
# or directly:
./scripts/verify_release.sh dist/anchorkit-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

The verify script checks the SHA-256 checksum, the detached signature, and the
bundle contents.  See [`docs/release-signing.md`](docs/release-signing.md) for
full key-management and CI integration guidance.

### Cleaning up

```bash
make clean-dist   # removes dist/
```

## Governance and Security

SorobanAnchor follows a documented governance and security model covering:

- **Roles** — Maintainers, Contributors, Security Reviewers, and on-chain Attestors.
- **Contract upgrades** — Require two maintainer approvals, a reproducible WASM build, and a published SHA-256 checksum. Only the admin address recorded at contract initialization may authorize upgrades.
- **Admin key management** — Multi-signature setup (2-of-N); keys are never committed to the repository; mainnet keys are stored on offline hardware wallets.
- **Dependency auditing** — `cargo audit` runs in CI on every PR; all dependencies are pinned to exact versions and `Cargo.lock` is committed.
- **Responsible disclosure** — Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub's security advisory feature. We follow coordinated disclosure with a 14-day fix window.

Full details: [`docs/governance-and-security.md`](docs/governance-and-security.md)

## Upgrading and Migration

When deploying a new contract version to production, follow the step-by-step
upgrade playbook which covers prerequisites, WASM upload, schema migration,
post-upgrade verification, and a full rollback procedure.

- **Migration guide** — schema versioning, data preservation, and example migration code: [`docs/migration-guide.md`](docs/migration-guide.md)
- **Upgrade playbook** — complete production runbook (pre-flight, upgrade, verify, rollback): [`docs/upgrade-playbook.md`](docs/upgrade-playbook.md)

## Coverage Thresholds

CI enforces minimum line-coverage percentages for the critical modules and
reports regressions relative to the `main` branch baseline.

| Module | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| `contract.rs` | ≥ 85 % |
| `rate_limiter.rs` | ≥ 90 % |
| `retry.rs` | ≥ 90 % |
| `transaction_state_tracker.rs` | ≥ 85 % |

Run locally:

```bash
./scripts/coverage_with_thresholds.sh

# Compare against a saved baseline and flag regressions > 2 %:
./scripts/coverage_with_thresholds.sh \
    --baseline /tmp/baseline.json \
    --report-delta
```

Full details: [`docs/coverage-metrics.md`](docs/coverage-metrics.md)
