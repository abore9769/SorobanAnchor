//! Round-trip serialization test for `ErrorCode` (issue #1316).
//!
//! Stable numeric error codes are part of the public API: integrations and
//! diagnostics rely on the code values not changing between releases.
//!
//! This file adds a focused round-trip test that:
//! 1. Casts a well-documented `ErrorCode` variant to its `u32` discriminant.
//! 2. Confirms the discriminant matches the documented value.
//! 3. Reconstructs the variant from the raw `u32` to verify the round-trip.
//!
//! The representative code chosen is `ReplayAttack = 6`, which is:
//! - In the stable Auth/attestor range (1–10).
//! - Documented in `docs/error-codes.md` and `docs/CONTRACT_FUNCTIONS.md`.
//! - Referenced in integration tests and the public API surface.
//!
//! Acceptance criteria (from issue #1316):
//! - The code retains its documented numeric value.
//! - Round-trip behaviour matches the public API (`as u32` cast).
//! - No error numbering changes are included.
