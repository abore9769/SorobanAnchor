//! Off-chain helpers for anchor health monitoring and proof-of-possession.
//!
//! # Proof-of-possession protocol
//!
//! The proof-of-possession (PoP) flow lets an anchor prove it controls the
//! endpoint it advertises without requiring a live HTTP round-trip from the
//! contract itself (Soroban contracts cannot make outbound HTTP calls).
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. Anchor publishes a challenge nonce in its stellar.toml:
//!       ANCHOR_PROOF_CHALLENGE = "<hex-encoded 32-byte nonce>"
//!
//! 2. Off-chain monitor fetches the challenge and computes:
//!       proof_hash = SHA-256(challenge_bytes || endpoint_bytes)
//!
//! 3. Anchor calls AnchorKitContract::register_endpoint_proof(
//!       anchor, endpoint, proof_hash)
//!    on-chain, binding its Stellar identity to the endpoint.
//!
//! 4. Any verifier calls AnchorKitContract::verify_endpoint_proof(
//!       anchor, proof_hash)
//!    to confirm the hash matches and mark the record as verified.
//! ```
//!
//! The helpers in this module implement step 2 and provide utilities for
//! health-event recording that wrap the contract calls.
//!
//! # Health scoring model
//!
//! Beyond the simple uptime counter stored on-chain, the off-chain scoring
//! model combines four signals into a single 0–100 composite score:
//!
//! | Signal              | Weight | Description                                  |
//! |---------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
//! | Success rate        |  0.40  | Fraction of calls that succeeded             |
//! | Latency             |  0.25  | How close p50 latency is to a target floor   |
//! | Routing failures    |  0.20  | Fraction of routing attempts that failed     |
//! | Recovery behaviour  |  0.15  | How quickly the anchor recovered after drops |
//!
//! Trend analysis compares the latest window against the previous one and
//! classifies the direction as `Improving`, `Stable`, or `Degrading`.
