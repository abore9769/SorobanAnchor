//! Error types for AnchorKit
//!
//! All errors are represented as [`AnchorKitError`], a unified base error type
//! carrying a [`code`](AnchorKitError::code), [`message`](AnchorKitError::message),
//! and optional [`context`](AnchorKitError::context).
//!
//! The [`ErrorCode`] enum enumerates every distinct error kind. Use the
//! provided constructor helpers (e.g. [`AnchorKitError::already_initialized`])
//! to build errors without touching raw codes.
