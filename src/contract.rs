// #247 — on-chain schema versioning
//
// Each persistent contract type carries a `schema_version: u32` field.
// The version is bumped only when the serialized shape changes in a way that
// is incompatible with old stored values (e.g. a field is added or removed).
//
// Version history:
//   SCHEMA_V1 = 1  — initial versioned layout (introduced in this release)
//   SCHEMA_V2 = 2  — adds `routing_reason: Option<String>` to [`Quote`]
//
// Migration strategy:
//   After a WASM upgrade that increments a schema version, call `migrate()`
//   as admin. The migrate function reads entries with the old schema version
//   and rewrites them with the new one.  Because Soroban XDR decoding is
//   strict, old unversioned values (implicitly "V0") will fail to decode into
//   the new type; the migration must handle that by catching panics or by
//   storing a versioned wrapper enum around the concrete type.
